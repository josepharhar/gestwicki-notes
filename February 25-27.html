changes to protocol described below<br/></div></li><li><div>DnaJA1 was previously expressed in Rosetta cells, grown to OD ~0.8, cooled to 18C for 1 hour, then induced with 500uM IPTG and grown overnight at 18C, 160 RPM; 4L total culture was pelleted and stored at -80C for purification</div></li></ul><div><span>    February 25</span><br/></div><ul><li><div>4L was resuspended in ~150mL lysis buffer, dounce homogenized, and the full volume was passed 3 times through the Agard lab microfluidizer; resulting lysate was still relatively viscous, despite microfluidizing</div></li><li><div>after centrifugation at 30,000xg for 50 min, supernatant was still more viscous than anticipated</div></li><li><div>during centrifugation, 5mL packed Ni-NTA resin was washed first with water, then with lysis buffer (~10 CV)</div></li><li><div>before incubating lysate with Ni-NTA resin, it was 0.45um filtered (both syringe and filter bottle); this step proved to be extremely difficult, even after diluting 2-fold with more lysis buffer; due to this difficulty, only ~25% of starting lysate was moved to the next step</div></li><li><div>lysate was incubated at 4C for 1 hour in a sealed column with equilibrated Ni-NTA resin</div></li><li><div>flowthrough was collected, followed by 10 CV each of high salt and low salt wash buffers (both with 6mM BME)</div></li><li><div>protein was eluted with 50mL (5 CV) of elution buffer (with 6mM BME); upon buffer addition, the first 10mL was immediately collected, and the subsequent elutions were collected after a short incubation period (~10-15 min)</div></li></ul><div><span>    February 26</span><br/></div><ul><li><div><span>all elution fractions contained DnaJA1 by gel analysis and were pooled for ion exchange chromatography (skipping cleavage of his tag by thrombin protease)</span></div></li><li><div>elution was diluted with Buffer A (with 6mM BME) to 150mL total for injection onto Mono Q column via mega loop (holds 150mL)</div></li><li><div>after filtering the resulting 150mL, protein precipitation was observed upon dropwise addition of Buffer A to top off the mega loop (presumably due to local low salt concentration)</div></li><li style=""><div>due to protein precipitation, the 150mL sample was dialyzed into an intermediate buffer (meant to match thrombin cleavage buffer that was diluted with Buffer A by Cynthia during her prep): 26mM HEPES, 90mM KCl, 1mM CaCl2—no reducing agent</div></li><li><div>after chilling 8L of the above described buffer, the sample was split into 2 10K dialysis tubes; in one of these, 1 aliquot of 200 units of thrombin protease from the Stroud lab was added; the two samples were allowed to dialyze in 4L of buffer for ~2 hours at 4C</div></li><li><div>after 2 hours of dialysis, significant protein precipitation was observable in the sample without thrombin; sample with thrombin showed little/no precipitation (see attached photo)</div></li></ul><ul><li><div>both samples were transferred to fresh 4L of buffer and allowed to dialyze overnight</div></li></ul><div><span>    February 27</span><br/></div><ul><li><div>after overnight dialysis, both samples showed some level of precipitation, notably less for sample with thrombin</div></li><li><div>sample with thrombin was filtered and loaded into mega loop (~70mL total)</div></li><li><div>sample was loaded onto Mono Q pre-equilibrated with Buffer A, at 2 mL/min flow rate</div></li><li><div>protein was eluted in a gradient from 0-50% Buffer B, over 30 CV; 1.5mL fractions were collected through the course of the elution</div></li><li><div>major peak elution was observed at ~25% B (see attached trace)</div></li><li><div>fractions 5.F.8-5.G.4 were pooled and concentrated to ~1mL by successive 4000xg 2 minute spins at 4C using 15mL 10K concentrator unit (~20 spins)</div></li><li><div>over the course of ~30 min on ice at 4C, the sample became visually cloudy</div></li><li><div>after filtering, sample was diluted to 4mL with SEC buffer and concentrated to 2mL</div></li><li><div>on ice, it seemed that cloudiness emerged from the bottom of the microcentrifuge tube—originating from where the sample was in closest contact to the ice</div></li><li><div>1mL of the filtered sample was loaded onto pre-equilibrated SEC75 column (~24mL column volume)</div></li><li><div>to maintain a stable system pressure, SEC75 was run at 0.3 mL/min flow rate, while collecting 250uL fractions</div></li><li><div>protein eluted over fractions A12-B5 (see attached trace)</div></li><li><div>SEC75 was repeated for remaining 1mL of sample, with protein eluting over the same fractions</div></li><li><div>elutions from each run were combined and concentrated to ~300uL total</div></li><li><div>final concentration by nano drop for run 1 was 1.26 mg/mL = 28.06 uM;
