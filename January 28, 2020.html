It is unclear what may have caused this; because tracer was evenly distributed throughout the solution, any small errors in volume/final concentration would be equally propagatedâ€”this does not explain the increase in signal at middling peptide concentrations. Perhaps buffer conditions or other factors contributed; with a small-scale control (250uM Hsp72 10mer, free C-term), it seems that successful competition would have likely decreased the signal to less than 100mP, which was not observed for the amidated peptide</div><div><a href="January%2028,%202020.html.resources/012820%20DJB4%20competition%20FP%20amidated%20Hsp72%2010mer.pdf">012820 DJB4 competition FP amidated Hsp72 10mer.pdf</a><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
