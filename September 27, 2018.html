While dilute, DJA1 and DJB1 samples seem to form canonical dimers, as well as some higher order species (tetramers?). DJB4 is not visible on the gel. Finally, DJB6 seems to form three separate, distinct oligomeric species, one of which is of an average higher mass than the average largest DJA2 oligomer.</div><div><br/></div><div><img src="September%2027,%202018.html.resources/092718%20JDP%20Native%20Gel.tif" /><br/></div><div><br/></div></body></html>
